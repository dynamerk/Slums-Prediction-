Future Slum Growth Prediction — Kibera (Nairobi, Kenya) & Katanga (Kampala, Uganda)
Overview
This project utilizes linear regression modeling to analyze and predict changes in land use and land cover (LULC) within two major urban slums: Kibera in Nairobi, Kenya, and Katanga in Kampala, Uganda. The model leverages historical LULC percentage data from 2000 to 2024 to forecast trends through 2030.

Key Findings & Visual Insights
Kibera, Nairobi
Built-up Area: Exhibits a consistent increase from approximately 83% in 2000 to an estimated 95% by 2030, reflecting rapid urban expansion.

Bare Land: Shows a significant decline, indicating conversion of open land to built environment.

Vegetation Cover & Water Density: Both demonstrate a decreasing trend, signaling potential loss of green spaces and water bodies, which may affect urban ecosystem health.

Katanga, Kampala
Built-up Area: Increases steadily from about 65% to over 90%, highlighting significant densification and development.

Bare Land: Displays fluctuations but trends toward a moderate presence by 2030.

Vegetation Cover & Water Density: Markedly decline over time, consistent with urban growth pressures.

Methodology
Data: Historical LULC percentages for four classes — Bare Land (BL), Built-up Area (BA), Vegetation Cover (VC), and Water Density (WD).

Modeling: Linear regression models fitted separately for each LULC class using time series data.

Prediction: Extrapolation of trends to estimate LULC proportions in 2030.

Visualization: Comparative plots showing observed data points, regression trendlines, and 2030 predictions.

Implications
The expansion of built-up areas at the expense of vegetation and water highlights challenges for urban sustainability and environmental management.

Predictive modeling provides planners and policymakers with actionable insights to guide slum upgrading, infrastructure development, and environmental conservation strategies.

Outputs
Visualizations: High-resolution plots illustrating LULC trends and future projections for Kibera and Katanga.

Codebase: Python scripts implementing the regression analysis and visualization workflow.
